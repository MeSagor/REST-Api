<h1 align="center">REST Api with Express and MongoDB</h1>

***This Project is all about making a Rest Api where a user hits some end-points and gets some responses(json data) from
the Api. Here I also use proper user authentication (jwt) to validate a user. A user can't get json data without 
validate(login) his/her identity.***
